# MSDS692
**Project Summary**

Abstract:
The goal of the experiment is to examine the results of two distinct toolsets doing the same [Machine Learning Data Pipeline: the comparsion is done by accomplishing a Arificial Neural Network experiment on both platforms.] analysis on the same data. It is meant to compare the usefulness of each tool while accomplishing each step of the experiment.

The chosen Machine Learning Method: Artificial Neural Network

# Data Preparation
Data Preparation can be reviewed here: https://github.com/jk8761/MSDS692/blob/master/DataPrep.flv

Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Preparation
                           This task was done using R-Studio

Exploratory Data Analysis and the initial Data Preparation is an absolute necessity for each toolset being evaluated. This step is done once only and the resulting clean data is used for R-Studio and Azure Machine Learning Studio

The Dataset: Mushroom data set:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom

Variable Importance, Feature Selection
Variable and feature selection have become the focus of much research in areas of application for which datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of variables are available. These areas include text processing of internet documents, gene expression array analysis, and combinatorial chemistry.

Considering Normalization
In statistics and applications of statistics, normalization can have a range of meanings. In the simplest cases, normalization of ratings means adjusting values measured on different scales to a notionally common scale, often prior to averaging.

Correlations close to 1 indicate strong linear relationships between two variables

First Run Artificial Neural Network on R-Studio
These correlations reflect hidden layers = 1 and resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking 

First Run Accuracy: 0.9130414696

# MSDS692
**Project Summary**
This project compares R-Studio and Azure Machine Learning Studio. 
The comparsion is done by accomplishing a Arificial Neural Network experiment on both platforms.

# Data Preparation
Data Preparation can be reviewed here: https://github.com/jk8761/MSDS692/blob/master/DataPrep.flv

Abstract:
The goal of the experiment is to examine the results of two distinct toolsets doing the same [Machine Learning Data Pipeline] analysis on the same data. It is meant to compare the usefulness of each tool while accomplishing each step of the experiment.
The chosen Machine Learning Method: Artificial Neural Network

The Dataset: Mushroom data set:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom

This presentation compares the resulting Data Pipelines (DP). The first DP is accomplished using the toolset R-Studio (RS). The second DP is accomplished using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (AML).

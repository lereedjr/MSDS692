**Project Summary**

Abstract:
The goal of the experiment is to examine the results of two distinct toolsets doing the same [Machine Learning Data Pipeline: the comparsion is done by accomplishing a Arificial Neural Network experiment on both platforms.] analysis on the same data. It is meant to compare the usefulness of each tool while accomplishing each step of the experiment.

The chosen Machine Learning Method: Artificial Neural Network

# Data Preparation
Data Preparation can be reviewed here: https://github.com/jk8761/MSDS692/blob/master/DataPrep.flv

Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Preparation
                           This task was done using R-Studio

Exploratory Data Analysis and the initial Data Preparation is an absolute necessity for each toolset being evaluated. This step is done once only and the resulting clean data is used for R-Studio and Azure Machine Learning Studio

The Dataset: Mushroom data set:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom

# Data Manipulations

# Artificial Neural Network: R-Studio

# Artificial Neural Network: Azure Machine Learning Studio
